<h1>Analysis I<h1>
<p>Axioms for, and properties of, the real numbers; sequences; functions of a real variable, continuity, and differentiation.
Rigorous definitions of convergence and limit underpin a proof-based treatment of the subject material.
Intended for Honours students in Mathematics.<p>

<p>Prerequisites: SC/MATH 1200 3.00, SC/MATH 1310 3.00 or ISCI 1402 3.00 or ISCI 1410 6.00, or permission of the instructor.
Course credit exclusion: GL/MATH 3320 3.00.<p>

  <b>Office hours:</b> By appointment. I am in most days (except on Friday for a seminar downtown) but am often busy with meetings or other administrative duties. If I am free, I am happy to help you if you just drop by, but if you want to make sure that I am available to help, send me an email to make an appointment.

  <b>MATH/STATS Lab</b> This is a drop in tutoring lab staffed by faculty and graduate students in our department. Hours TBA.

  <b>Prerequisites </b>MATH 1300, MATH 1310 and MATH 1200

  <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1567547127510_60"><b>Grading</b></p>
  1. There will be several homework assignments during the term worth a total of 30% of your grade

  2. There will be one in-class midterm worth 30% of your grade.

  3. A Final Exam worth 40% of your grade.

  <b>Homework Assignments</b> All assignments are to be submitted on this Moodle site on or before 12:00 (noon) on the announced due date. (Do not email me your solutions). Assignments should be compiled into a pdf file using the LateX mathematical document system (more about this later). Homework problems will be assigned (with deadlines) in almost every lecture with ample time to complete them. The first assignment is designed to review the material from Chapters 1, 2 and section 3.1 that should have been covered in MATH 1200, and will give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with LaTeX.

  It is perfectly acceptable to work together with other students in the class on this assignment, but I expect you to clearly state on your homework assignment if you received help, or relied on another person to complete the assignment. Completing a homework assignment that was copied from another source or completed by somebody else and handing it in as your own is a violation of the York Policy on Academic Honesty (see more about Academic Honesty in the paragraph below).

  <b>Tests.</b> The tentative date for the midterm test is October 29. The Final Exam schedule has not yet been set.

  <b>Syllabus</b> The main goal of the course is to give a rigorous treatment of the fundamental notions concerning the real number line, properties of functions on the reals, and proofs of the central theorems found in the study of Calculus (e.g., the Intermediate Value Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem and, hopefully, The Fundamental Theorem of Caculus). I will try to cover Chapters 3-9 of the text but we will probably not get to all of it and we will cover only a good selection from the later chapters. Chapters 1, 2 and section 3.1 should be familiar to you and will not be covered. It is probably worth your while to read over this material as I am assuming all, except possibly sections 2.4 and 2.5, is familiar to you.
